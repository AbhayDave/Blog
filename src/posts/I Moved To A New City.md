P.S This is me first time writing something. I got this idea while listening to song named [SAFAR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWuFhYiD9zM) of "NOTEBOOK" (2019) movie to because I was not able to sleep. I read some blogs after writing this thing and then wrote this again tried to make it something like a real blog. If you find some mistakes or want to tell me something similar please do. 😅

Today is Rakhi an Indian Festival, and This is the first time I am far from my home not with my sister and cousins. I am writing this at 1:30 AM in the night and you know the reason why I already mentioned it above so I hope you enjoy or get something from it.

so here it goes...

> "Don’t be afraid to do hard things! The scariest thing in life is looking back and realizing that nothing in our lives has changed in the last 5, 10, or 20 years."

This quote popped up on my Instagram feed while scrolling reels, and after reading it, here I am with my not-so-great English, writing my first blog. 

I moved to a new city for an internship without knowing a single person who lived there. The first time I did something similar was when I went off to college. I chose a small private college where I didn’t know anyone. I wanted a fresh start with people who had no past judgments of me, and that’s exactly what I got.

Feeling too comfortable in my life at college, I always wanted the opportunity to switch things up. I’ve wanted to travel and challenge myself to experience something new.

I had always dreamed of working in a big MNC located in cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Pune, or Bangalore, but due to the recession and layoffs in IT industry. I was thinking about pursuing masters from IIT or abroad right after graduating, but life had different plans. Safe to say, I ended up loving what i got and I am grateful to God for making this dream come true.

Moving is scary. Chances are you don’t know anyone in the new city and have no idea how to navigate it. When I first arrived in Bangalore, I was intimidated by the public transportation system. I’m pretty sure I walked 6 kilometers to the office the first few days just to avoid it! 😅

I have to depend on Google Maps to get around everywhere all the time.

However, it’s the scariest things in life that are also the most exciting.

How many times are you going to move somewhere new and get to discover all of its charms for the first time? There’s nothing like finding your new favorite South Indian restaurant, exploring the vibrant streets, or stumbling upon a local temple that you'll visit daily.

Now, I think it’s important that we push ourselves to try new places and step out of our bubbles while we are young and have the opportunity to do so. With every new place we go, we discover a new part of ourselves.

# Meeting New People

One of the biggest benefits of moving to a new place is the variety of people you meet. Each time, you need to be a little more creative in how you make friends. College was a great first run because everyone is trying to meet new people. Everyone is forced out of their comfort zones.

In Bangalore, In my office, I met people from countries like Singapore, United States, and UK. This was a great practice run for me. I’ve always considered myself shy and introverted, so I knew I had to overcome my fear of starting conversations.

I stopped worrying about other people thoughts and tried talking to everyone..

At first, I thought I would make new friends easily, but after a few weeks, I realized that making friends who feel right takes time. It can’t be rushed.

While making friends, I came to understand what I do and don’t want in relationships. In college, I was almost friends with anyone who showed some interest in or talked to me. But here, I started to really look for people who share similar interests and values.

Moving to a new city forces you to get creative in how you meet these friends. Instead of settling for friends who are convenient, I tried to meet people through shared hobbies like movies and cooking.

# Trying New Things

Every city has its own activities that it is known for. Bangalore is more outdoorsy and has great hiking trails and hills, but so far, I have not explored those things.

But,

I visited a club for the first time in my life and quickly realized that I am not a club person 😁.

Moving away gives us a chance to start anew and find a truer version of ourselves.
With new hobbies and new friends come new things we learn about ourselves.

One of those lessons is through pain. Yes, it’s painful at first to move away from everything we know and love, and there's no denying that.

However, it showed me my fears and attachments. I wondered why I was feeling pain from being away from my hometown, and I got the answer from a stranger who is now my friend. He said something beautiful that I’m pretty sure he read on social media:

> "Places don’t define us. Happiness comes from within, not from where we are."

After talking to him, I started to get out a little more and explored nearby places alone.

You learn more about yourself while being away from your comfort zone in a few months than you would in that comfort for years. Your growth compounds when you don’t have familiar people and routines to lean on.

We live our lives on autopilot once we have a certain job, a set group of friends, and our “places” that we go to every week. How often do we really try new things? As humans, we love what’s familiar and stress-free! It makes life easier to comprehend and predict.

# Conclusion

This is the first small step in my journey. This is the first time and the furthest I’ve lived from where I grew up. It’s scary to go to a new city, but it’s also really exciting.

Now I am certain that I am going to find new hobbies, new friends, and a new routine.
It will be more firsts than I’ve experienced in a long time. It’s a chance to start fresh, try the hobbies I’ve always wanted to explore, and find the types of friends I’ve always wanted to meet.

I’ll have to put myself out there and introduce myself to random strangers. I could meet people who will change my life forever or discover a new passion.

Sure, it is scary at first. However, I know it will be worth it.

Thank you reading my blog,

Will meet you next time with some new experiences and learnings' 😊
