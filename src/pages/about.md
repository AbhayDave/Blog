Hey there! I'm Abhay.

I'm a software engineer into Full Stack Development, Linux, open source, DevOps, and system design. While I haven't contributed to any open source projects yet, I love using open source tools and frameworks.

Right now, I’m diving into system design and building full-stack projects to level up my skills. I enjoy solving problems and discovering new tech.

In my free time, you’ll find me tinkering with my Linux setup, cooking, exploring new tools, and teaching others.

Check out my portfolio to see my latest projects. I’m always up for connecting with fellow developers and sharing experiences!
